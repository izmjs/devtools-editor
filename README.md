## Getting started
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/moidrissi/devtools.git
cd devtools
npm install
npm start
```

## Useful Commands
  * `npm start` - starts a dev server and opens browser with running app
  * `npm run test` - runs lint and tests
  * `npm run watch` - runs tests in watch mode
  * `npm run cy:open` - opens the Cypress Test Runner in interactive mode
  * `npm run cy:run` - runs Cypress tests via the cli
  * `npm run prod` - runs full prod build and serves prod bundle
  * `npm run prettier` - runs prettier to format whole code base (`.ts` and `.scss`) 
  * `npm run analyze` - runs full prod build and `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to visualize how much code is shipped (dependencies & application) 
  * `npm run compodoc` - runs [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app) to generate a static documentation of the application 


## Run Inside Docker Container
  * `docker build -t material-starter .` - builds docker image with name `material-starter`
  * `docker run -it \
   -v ${PWD}:/usr/src/app \
   -v /usr/src/app/node_modules \
   -p 4200:4200 \
   --rm \
   material-starter` - starts `material-starter` container (you can access running application browsing http://localhost:4200) 

### Serving a Docker image
When you are ready to serve your application the process has been made simple through the use of `Production.Dockerfile` and `Production.docker-compose.yml`.

From the root directory of the project simply run `docker-compose -f Production.docker-compose.yml build`. After this has run you can test your image locally by running `docker-compose -f Production.docker-compose.yml up`. Run `docker-compose -f Production.docker-compose.yml down` once you are done looking over the website so that docker cleans up all the resources related to it.

Npm scripts are also available to save having to write such a long command.

#### Npm Scripts

The following npm scripts correspond to the docker-compose commands.

| Npm Script       | Docker Compose       |
|------------------|----------------------|
| docker:prod      | docker-compose build |
| docker:prod-up   | docker-compose up    |
| docker:prod-down | docker-compose down  |

#### Continuous Integration
Starter project is using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for running linters and tests on every commit.
Based on your preferences and needs you can either:

  * not use / use other CI server and delete both `.travis.yml` and `.travis-deploy.sh`
  * create Travis CI account and link it to your projects Github repo and [configure build](https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/continuous-deployment-of-client-side-apps-with-github-pages-travis-ci-10e9d641a889) 
    with `GH_REF` and `GH_TOKEN` environment variables for automatic deployment of releases to Github Pages
